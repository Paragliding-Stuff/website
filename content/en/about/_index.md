We are passionate about beautiful designs and cool things about paragliding. We are a creative illustrator and an enthusiastic paraglider pilot.


In 2018 we started to create products with paraglider motifs. The products are manufactured and shipped by PrintOnDemand suppliers. We work with Spreadshirt, Zazzle and Society6.


## Illustrations

The motifs of our products are created using a wide variety of methods. Generally, they are drawn in the classic way with a pencil, ballpoint pen or highlighter. Then they are photographed with Adobe Capture on the iPhone and colored and processed with Photoshop.

However, other methods and procedures are also used. Some motifs are created completely on the computer, others are drawn completely on paper with watercolor, gouache or highlighter and then scanned.

In addition to the paragliding motifs, we also create other motifs that are offered for sale in other shops and websites.
